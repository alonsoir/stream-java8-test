# stream-java8-test
Playing with functional java8 style streaming api. <br />

# How to use <br />

You can import to eclipse the maven project and run the tests or you can compile the project and run it within your local shell, or creating your local docker container or pulling one created and pushed by me: <br />

# To pull my docker container <br />

docker pull aironman:mystreamjava8:latest <br />

# To run my docker container <br />
$ docker images
aironman/mystreamjava8   latest              71d2c3357c55        12 minutes ago      643MB <br />

docker run -it 71d2c3357c55 /bin/bash <br />

root@7afd5ea86e03:/# bash /scripts/runMe.sh em 1 files/Euromillones2004_2018.csv files/primitiva.csv <br /> 

# To compile the project

git clone https://github.com/alonsoir/stream-java8-test.git <br />
mvn clean package <br />

# To show Euromillions and primitiva in local mode<br />

java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests all 80 PATH_TO/Euromillones2004_2018.csv PATH_TO/primitiva.csv. <br /> 

80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To show only Euromillions <br />

java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests em 80. 80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To show only primitiva <br />

java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests primitiva 80. 80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To run the project with the shell script <br />

Done. Time duration: 1 secs.<br />
<br />
It will generate two files, final_output_star_martes\,\ \ 4\ de\ diciembre\ de\ 2018\,\ 13\:18\:13\ CET.txt<br /> 
and final_output_winners_martes\,\ \ 4\ de\ diciembre\ de\ 2018\,\ 13\:18\:13\ CET.txt.<br />
The name of the files is created using the pattern final_output_winners_$actual_date.txt and final_output_star_$actual_date.txt<br />
$actual_date is the actual date using unix format.<br />
<br />
100 means the number of iterations, 100 predictions. <br />
<br />

# Dependencies <br />

The Project needs maven, java8 to compile and run the jar, some unix commands to run the script and docker if you want to run a container: <br />
tr <br />
sort <br />
uniq <br />
awk  <br />
 <br />

I think these unix commands come by default in osx and I think they also come by default in linux, not sure in windows.  <br />
