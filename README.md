# java8-streaming
Playing with functional java8 style streaming api. <br />

# How to use <br />
You can import to eclipse the maven project and run the tests or you can compile the project and run it with next command: <br />

# To show Euromillions and primitiva <br />
java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests all 80. 80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To show only Euromillions <br />
java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests em 80. 80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To show only primitiva <br />
java -cp target/MyStreamjava8-1.0.jar com.aironman.ApiStreamTests primitiva 80. 80 means the number of iterations, 80 predictions.<br />

# To run the project with the shell script <br />
sh runMe.sh em 100 /PATH/TO/Euromillones2004_2018.csv /PATH/TO/primitiva.csv<br />

It will generate two files, final_output_star_martes\,\ \ 4\ de\ diciembre\ de\ 2018\,\ 13\:18\:13\ CET.txt<br /> 
and final_output_winners_martes\,\ \ 4\ de\ diciembre\ de\ 2018\,\ 13\:18\:13\ CET.txt.<br />
The name of the files is created using the pattern final_output_winners_$actual_date.txt and final_output_star_$actual_date.txt<br />
$actual_date is the actual date using unix format.<br />
<br />
100 means the number of iterations, 100 predictions. <br />

# Dependencies<br />
The Project needs maven, java8 to compile and run the jar, some unix commands to run the script and docker if you want to run a container: <br />
tr <br />
sort <br />
uniq <br />
awk  <br />
 <br />

I think these unix commands come by default in osx and I think they also come by default in linux, not sure in windows.  <br />
